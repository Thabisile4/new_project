# Question

What should you do if a staff member disagrees with your review?

# Answer

1. Enhances Your Understanding of the Code
Deeper understanding: When reviewing someone else’s code, you get the opportunity to look at problems and solutions from different perspectives. This helps reinforce your understanding of concepts and techniques you may not have considered or fully understood before.
Learning new approaches: You can pick up new methods and approaches from the submitter’s code, including new patterns, libraries, or tools. It exposes you to alternative ways of solving problems.
Spotting mistakes: Reviewing others’ work helps you develop a keen eye for identifying common errors or bugs. This sharpens your debugging skills, which is essential for your growth as a developer.
2. Improves Your Own Code Quality
Reflect on your own work: When reviewing others’ code, you often end up thinking about your own coding habits, styles, and practices. You may find areas where your code could be improved or optimized.
Adopting better practices: By analyzing others’ code, you learn about best practices that you may not have encountered. It can help you improve your own code in terms of readability, efficiency, and maintainability.
Staying consistent: Consistent, high-quality reviews lead you to hold yourself to a higher standard, fostering a habit of writing cleaner, more maintainable code in your own projects.
3. Improves Your Communication Skills
Clear, constructive feedback: Giving thoughtful feedback improves your ability to communicate technical concepts in a clear and constructive manner. You’ll learn how to explain complex ideas in simple terms, a critical skill for collaborating in teams.
Balancing criticism and encouragement: Giving feedback requires you to learn how to be honest about what needs improvement while still being supportive and motivating. This helps you develop your emotional intelligence and tact—key skills for any professional environment.
4. Strengthens Collaboration and Teamwork
Fosters a collaborative mindset: Participating in the review process builds a sense of community and collaboration. As you contribute to others’ growth, you encourage an environment where feedback is valued, and everyone works together to improve their skills.
Better teamwork: When reviewing work within a team, you become more familiar with the coding standards and practices of your colleagues. This ensures that the entire team works cohesively and produces more consistent results.
Building trust: Effective reviews demonstrate your commitment to the success of the team or project. Your willingness to engage and help others grow builds mutual trust and respect within the group.
5. Reinforces Critical Thinking and Problem Solving
Problem analysis: As a reviewer, you need to critically assess the code to identify what works, what doesn’t, and why. This improves your problem-solving abilities, as you’re often looking for the best ways to optimize or refactor code.
Identifying edge cases: Reviewing code often pushes you to think about edge cases and test conditions you might not have considered when working on your own projects. This boosts your ability to create robust, error-free code.
