# Question

If you are learning to code, when should you put your repo card into the review column?

# Answer

When the Feature or Task is Complete
The code is finished: All the features or tasks you've set out to complete in your repo are done. For example, if you've been working on a feature like a function, bug fix, or a set of tests, and it’s complete, it’s time to review.
No major issues left: You've addressed any issues or bugs, and everything is working as expected. You may have run tests or manually verified the functionality.
