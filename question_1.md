### Purpose of the `ls` command

The `ls` command is used to list files and directories in the current working directory. It displays the contents of a directory, allowing users to see what files and subdirectories are present. 

You can also use various options with `ls` to modify the output, such as displaying hidden files or providing detailed information about each item.
