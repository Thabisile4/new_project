# Question

What are the consequences of marking something as competent and a staff member marking it as not yet competent?

# Answer

1. Impact on Learner’s Progress
Delayed Progress: If the learner’s submission is marked as NYC by staff, despite their own self-assessment being competent, they may face delays in progressing to the next stage or project. This could affect their overall learning path and may result in feelings of frustration or confusion, as they might believe they have met the required standards.
Rework Required: The learner may be asked to revise or correct parts of their project based on feedback from the staff. This additional work can slow down their progress, especially if they are unclear about the areas that need improvement.
Loss of Confidence: If the learner believes they have completed the task successfully, being marked NYC can lead to demotivation and potentially doubt their abilities. They might feel like they’re not progressing or understanding the material correctly.
2. Feedback and Clarity
Misalignment in Expectations: There’s a possibility that the learner's expectations and the staff's expectations aren’t fully aligned. The learner might think their submission is up to standard, but the staff member could be looking for specific details, tests, or refinements that weren’t met.
Clarification Needed: Staff members must provide clear, specific feedback about what was missing or incorrect in the submission. Without this feedback, the learner may not understand how to improve or why they were marked NYC.
Inconsistent Marking: If the reviewer and the staff member have different interpretations of the competence criteria, it can cause inconsistencies in how students are evaluated. This can be especially confusing in a learning environment and reduce the trust in the review process.
3. Impact on the Review Process
Review Standards: When a learner's self-assessment differs from staff assessment, it signals a potential issue with the review process—either in the understanding of competency criteria by reviewers or a lack of clarity in what constitutes competency.
Reviewer Confidence: If staff mark a submission as NYC, and it’s in contrast to what you marked as competent, this may lead to questioning the accuracy of your review. It can also make the reviewing process feel less transparent and lead to confusion about the standards being applied.
Reviewers might reconsider their standards: If reviewers are unsure of how their reviews align with the staff’s expectations, they may become hesitant or inconsistent in their future evaluations, affecting the quality of reviews across the board.
