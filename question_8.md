# Question

How should you prioritize which cards to review first?

# Answer

Focus on Pending or Overdue Reviews
Why: Reviews that are pending or overdue should be prioritized because they are already behind schedule, and addressing them promptly ensures you maintain a timely workflow.
How: Look for cards that have been sitting for too long without feedback or those marked as urgent or with tight deadlines.
2. Review Less Complex Cards First
Why: If you have a long list of cards to review, start with those that are easier to assess. This helps you clear through a number of reviews quickly and gain momentum.
How: Identify simpler tasks that might require just a quick glance to check whether they meet basic requirements. These could be tasks with only minor bugs or straightforward implementations.
3. Review Based on Importance or Impact
Why: Some projects or cards may have more significant impact on the overall project, team, or learning path.
How: Prioritize cards that are critical to the project, such as those that influence the direction of others or are foundational. For instance, a bug in a core library or feature might be more urgent than one in a peripheral component.
4. Review Tasks from Learners Who Are Waiting for Feedback
Why: If someone has completed their work and is waiting for feedback to move forward, prioritizing their review helps avoid unnecessary delays in their learning journey.
How: Look for cards that have been submitted recently, particularly if the learner is waiting for feedback before they can progress to the next challenge or task.
5. Review Cards from Learners Who Are Behind
Why: If a learner is falling behind, it’s important to get them back on track. Providing timely reviews for their work can help them catch up and feel supported.
How: Check for learners who are behind on deadlines or have multiple unreviewed tasks. Helping them move forward will reduce the backlog and keep the learning process smooth.
6. Prioritize Cards with Incomplete or Inaccurate Submissions
Why: If you notice that a card has obvious issues—such as incomplete work or major mistakes—tackling these reviews early helps to give the learner early guidance before they waste too much time on the wrong approach.
How: Identify cards with red flags
